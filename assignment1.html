        <ul>
          <li>
            I chose this UI mockup design because I could not find a website
            that had this type of design.
          </li>
          <li>
            I chose this design because it is simplistic and modern looking
            while also being able to be highly customized and responsive when
            desired.
          </li>
          <li>
            I enjoy this type of layout because you are able to view all your
            tabs/pages easily while you can view all the content of the current
            page.
          </li>
